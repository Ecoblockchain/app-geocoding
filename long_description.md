Urban Parks is a **demo application** for PyBossa that shows how you can
crowdsourcing a geo localization problem.

This application uses a list of cities from all over the world. The goal is
really simple: navigate the map in order to find an urban park.

When the user finds one park, adds one marker to indicate the position and
saves the coordinates in GeoJSON format to easily parse it at a later stage.

## Results urban parks reported by the volunteers in a 3D globe

This 3D Globe uses the HTML5 WebGL technology for showing the results, each
blue pike represents and urban park submitted by a volunteer, almost in
realtime from this **demo application**.

You can rotate the globe by clicking on it and dragging it!

__ Error: Sorry, your browser or your GPU do not support WebGL so we can not
show you the results in a 3D Globe using WebGL.

If your browser and your computer would support **WebGL**, you will be able to
view the answers from the users in a 3D world globe like this:
