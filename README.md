PyBossa geo-demo project: Urban Parks in cities
===============================================

This demo project shows how you can use PyBossa for geo-coding problems.

The project is a simple demo that uses OpenLayers JavaScript library to load a map,
center it and add a point to the map, in order to mark the position of the
urban park. 

Thanks to the use of OpenLayers the data can be exported in any standard GIS format:
KML, GeoJSON, etc. In this project the answers are saved as GeoJSON.

The project has three files:

*  createTasks.py: for creating the project in PyBossa
*  template.html: the view for every task and deal with the data of the answers.
*  tutorial.html: a simple tutorial for the volunteers.

Testing the project:
====================
You need to install the pybossa-client (use a virtualenv):

```bash
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*  Create an account in PyBossa
*  Copy under your account your API-KEY
*  Run python createTasks.py -u http://crowdcrafting.org -k API-KEY
*  Open with your browser the *Projects section* and choose the Urban Parks 
   project. This will open the presenter for this demo project.
